# Clang-Tidy Automotive

This repository provides a collection of Clang-Tidy checks inspired by the 
goals and safety principles behind coding standards such as MISRA C:2023 
and MISRA C:2012.

The project does **not** reproduce any MISRA copyright content, including 
rule names, rule texts, or associated documentation. All the MISRA mapping
is put into a separate repository, see
[Clang-Tidy MISRA](https://github.com/PeterHallonmark/clang-tidy-misra/tree/main)
for more information.

**Note**: Official MISRA documents must be purchased and are protected 
by copyright. This project is independent and is not affiliated with or 
endorsed by the MISRA Consortium.

## Getting Started

To build clang-tidy Automotive, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 

Clang 19 (or compatible version)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PeterHallonmark/clang-tidy-automotive.git
   cd clang-tidy-misra
   ```

2. Run the following setup scripts to build Clang-Tidy Automotive:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ./configure.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

**Note:** The scripts will need to be adjusted to use a Docker container in
the future. This is part of the TODO list.

## Usage

To use the Automotive support in clang-tidy, enable the rules automotive-c23-* 
or automotive-c12-* when using clang-tidy. The example below assumes the 
avoid-goto.c test file and the root directory of clang-tidy-automotive.
   ```bash
   ./build/bin/clang-tidy --checks="misra-c2023-*" test/checkers/misra/c2023/avoid-goto.c -- 
   ```

See [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) for more information.

## License

The repository follows LLVM's license structure to make it easier to upstream
changes to the LLVM project if and when that happens. :)

## Future Improvements

Move setup scripts to a Docker container for easier setup and environment
management.
